         <h1>Utalk</h1>
         <p>In 2021, asynchronous English courses at UTP were scoring badly on student surveys. A major pain point: pronunciation practice. The existing tools were outdated, buggy, and unhelpful. Students couldn't trust the feedback, got frustrated, and quickly abandoned the exercises. Within three weeks of each semester, page views on pronunciation exercises dropped by over 80%.</p>
         <p>At the time, the ESL courses were using... hastily made, improvised exercises to let students practice their ESL pronunciation. It was obvious the software and tools being used weren't designed for that though, as we constantly fielded complaints about the exercises.</p>
         <h2>Constraints & Goals</h2>
         <p>We needed a tool that would:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Work without instructors being  present.</li>
               <li>Provide clear, immediate feedback.</li>
               <li>Run on any device/browser.</li>
               <li>Be usable by both young students and older working adults.</li>
               <li>Integrate seamlessly with Canvas (our LMS).</li>
           </ul>
        <p>Third-party tools were either too expensive and/or failed at scale. So we built Utalk: a custom Canvas plugin to handle pronunciation exercises that actually worked.</p>

      <h2>Users and Research</h2>
      <p>We had three target users:</p>
      <ol>
         <li><strong>Freshmen (17-21)</strong>: First time in higher ed, beginner English skills, decent tech skills on mobile.</li>
         <li><strong>Working adults (~34)</strong>: Time-strapped, beginner English skills, limited tech familiarity.</li>
         <li><strong>ESL Instructors</strong>: Needed a way to provide feedback without having 1:1 conversations.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Despite their differences, most students shared the same core needs:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Knowing what they did right or wrong.</li>
         <li>Learining how they can improve.</li>
         <li>Practicing anytime, from anywhere.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We co-created uTalk with ESL instructors in three ideation sessions. They helped us define core principles: <strong>fast, high-quality, always-on feedback.</strong></p>   
   <h2>Key Features</h2>
   <p>We translated user needs into concrete design decisions:</p>

      <h2>Testing & Rollout</h2>
      <p>We tested v1 with five students, asking them to complete simple tasks. After polishing some rough edges, uTalk was launched in 2022 in 24 classes (equivalent to about ~1,440 students total). We sent out a survey and interviewed some students about it after they got to use it. Their responses and some data showed:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>70% felt it helped their learning.</li>
         <li>90% said it was better than the previous system.</li>
         <li>Half said it was “very easy” to use.</li>
         <li>Page view drop diminished by 40% by week 7.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>On 2023, uTalk was rolled out to all ESL classes — serving ~90,000 students per semester.</p>
      <h2>Redesigning UTalk for the new LMS</h2>
      <p>In 2024, UTP switched from Canvas LMS to UTP+Class, a proprietary platform. So we updated UTalk's early UI to keep up with the switch.</p>
      <figure class="flex flex-row flex-wrap space-x-4">
         <img src="../img/utalk/001a.png" alt="">

         <figcaption class="w-full">Pic 2: The old 2019 exercises. Yes, that is a Google doc with STT turned on.</figcaption>
       </figure>
       <h2>Reflection </h2>
       <p>UTalk works because it's simple, responsive to real pain points, and grounded in co-design with teachers. If anything, the biggest learning was this: scale doesn't mean bloat. Good UX in edtech means stripping things down until they work for thousands of tired, under-resourced learners.</p>
