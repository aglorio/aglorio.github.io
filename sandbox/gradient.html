      <h1>Gradient</h1>
      <p>UTP course instructors and professors were having a rough time keeping up with grading deadlines for their course load. Factors like in-promptu student group creation and university policy were introducing extra problems in their already packed workflow. This also meant the feedback they gave students on their assignments was quite poor and generic. Students were missing out on important information that could help them improve their grades and academic performance. </p>
      <h2>What we wanted</h2>
      <p>We wanted a tool that helped professors grade more efficiently and offered students useful, actionable feedback.
         This way, we'd not only free up time spent on a highly repetitive task, but also increase the quality of the education students were receiving.
         However, not all assignments are equal and not every assignment is evaluated in the same manner. So we decided to limit our initial reach to the most common, predictable and standardized exams the university uses. These assignments:</p>      
         <ul>
          <li>Use a rubric</li>
          <li>Are written (no videos, presentations, etc)</li>
          <li>Are 'flexible' (can be group or individual tasks)</li>
         </ul>
      <p>With these basic requirements, we built Gradient. Gradient is an AI-powered automatic grader that also offers actionable feedback. It’s designed to work as an inbuilt feature in UTP’s proprietary LMS, UTP+Class.</p>

      <h2>Users & Research</h2>
      <p>We had three main stakeholders:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Professors/instructors</li>
         <li>Students</li>
         <li>Assignment designers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Their grading-related tasks are:</p>
